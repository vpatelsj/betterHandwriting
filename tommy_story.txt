Tommy was playing in his backyard when he heard a tiny meowing sound. He looked under the big oak tree and found a small orange kitten hiding behind some leaves. The kitten looked scared and hungry. Tommy ran inside to get his mom. She came out with a bowl of milk and some cat food. The kitten was very happy to eat and drink. Tommy's mom said they should put up posters to find the kitten's family. They made colorful signs with the kitten's picture. Tommy and his mom walked around the neighborhood putting up the posters. After two days, a little girl named Emma came to their door. She was crying because she had lost her kitten named Whiskers three days ago. When Emma saw the orange kitten, she smiled so big. Whiskers ran right to Emma and started purring loudly. Tommy felt happy inside knowing he helped Whiskers find his way home. Emma thanked Tommy and invited him to play with Whiskers anytime. Tommy learned that helping others feels really good. His mom was proud of his kind heart. That night, Tommy dreamed about all the animals he could help. He decided he wanted to become a veterinarian when he grew up. The next day, Tommy started reading books about animals and how to take care of them. He even built a small shelter in his backyard for any lost animals that might need help.
